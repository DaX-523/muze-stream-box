# Muze Stream Box

Muze Stream Box is an innovative music streaming platform that leverages Spotify APIs to offer an interactive and collaborative listening experience. Currently under development, this platform allows users to stream music, invite friends, suggest and upvote songs, and will soon include subscription features powered by Stripe.

## Features

- **Create and Share Streams:** Start a music stream and invite others to listen along in real-time.
- **Collaborative Queue Management:** Listeners can suggest new songs to the playlist, add them to the queue, and upvote tracks. The most upvoted songs rise to the top of the queue.
- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication is managed through NextAuth, providing a seamless sign-in experience.
- **Future Enhancements:** Plans to incorporate Stripe for payment processing, enabling membership and additional features.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** A React framework for server-side rendering and building web applications.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Spotify API:** Used for fetching and managing song streams.
- **NextAuth.js:** For secure user authentication.
